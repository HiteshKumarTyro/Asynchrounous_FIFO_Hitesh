# Asynchrounous_FIFO_Hitesh

Project Points:
1. Design of asynchronous FIFO for exchange of data frow two different write clock doomain and read clock domain.
2. N-bit width and N-depth FIFO is used so as that it can generelized for different burst rates.
3. Gray code representation is used for the synchronization of addresses shared between two different clock domains.
4. Two flop synchronizer is used to avoid metastabilty of the address pointers.
5. Full and empty conditions are also being implemented
